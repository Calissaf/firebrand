# Testing

* Testing is an esstential part of software development
* We use it to ensure our code meets client requirements
  * **Exhaustive Testing:**
  * Test absoultely everything possible. Fallacy. It cannot be done. Except for military, rocket science and brain surgery equipment as there is no margin for error.

## Unit testing

* Anything that can hold a value, interact with a value or even acknowledge a value...that is a unit
* Variable, constant, if statement, array, function, object, class, queue, list, stack...many more things!

## TDD (Test Driven Developement)

* Application that has code created driven by the tests we write
