# Day one

## web socket vs RESTFUL API (API = Application programme interface)

* websocket is contantly runing ayschronously waiting for commands
* Restful APIs only respond when poked (are in rest when not needed)
  * more efficient to use
  * cheaper

* CRUD
  * create
  * read
  * update
  * delete

* dev dependencies
  * declared in package-lock
  * states softwarfe that needs to be installed by any dev before running the program

## express handlebars

* allows you to create templates for body, nav bar etc..
* utilses modular based design

## Promise types

* used in data handling -- when getting and retreving data i.e. from APIs

* three states:
  * fufilled
  * rejected
  * pending
