## Cloud computing

* Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet enabling faster innovation flexible resources and economies of scale
  * kinda like going to someone house and borrowing there computer and using it in your own home
  * your borrowing resources from another location over the internet and acessing wherever you currently are
  * removes the worry of setting up infrastructure as its already been done by other people and you just rent the resources from them

* its broken into three areas:
  * compute
  * storage
  * networking

* Shared responsibility model:
  * Customer is ALWAYS responsible for
    * information and data
    * devices (mobiles and PCs)
    * accounts and identities
  * Cloud provider is ALWAYS reponsible for
    * physical hosts
    * physical network
    * physical datacenter
  * Responsibility varies for below depending on which service you've bought:
    * indentity and directory infrastructure
    * applications
    * network controls
    * operating systems

* ways to run infrastructue:
  * On premises
    * customer buys and owns everything software and physical its all setup and run by them every thing is their responsibility cloud provider is never involved
  * IaaS (infrastructure as a service)
    * cloud provider provides and is responsible for
      * physical hosts
      * physical network
      * physical datacenter
    * customer is reponsible for
      * indentity and directory infrastructure
      * applications
      * network controls
      * operating systems
      * information and data
      * devices (mobiles and PCs)
      * accounts and identities
  * PaaS (platform as a service)
    * cloud provider provides and is responsible for
      * physical hosts
      * physical network
      * physical datacenter
      * operating systems
    * customer is reponsible for
      * information and data
      * devices (mobiles and PCs)
      * accounts and identities
    * customer and clous provider share responsibilty for

* Private cloud
  * organizations create a cloud environment in their datacenter
  * organization is responsible for operating the services they provide
  * organizations owns everything and doesn't shae access to the network with anyone else

* Public cloud
  * Owned by cloud servies or hosting providers
  * provides resources abd services to multiple organizations
  * accessed via a secure network

* Hybrid cloud
  * combines public and private clouds to allow applications to run in the moast appropriate location
  
* cloud model comparison:
  * private
    * hardware must be purchased for start up and maintanance
    * organizations have complete control over resources and security
    * organizations are responsible for hardware and maintenance
  * public
    * no capital expenditures to scale up
    * applications can be quickly provistioned and deprovisioned
    * organizations pay only for what they use
  * hybrid
    * provides the most flexibility
    * organizations determine where to run their applications
    * ..

* Capital expendature vs Operational expedature
  * capital (CapEX)
    * the up front spending of money on physical infrastrusture
    * cost from capEx have a value that reduces over time
  * operational (OpEx)
    * spend on products and services as needed, pay-as-you-go
    * get billed immediately

* cloud reduces CapEx and charges OpEx for an organization

* Consumption based model
  * cloud services providers operate on a consumption-based model, which mean that end users only pay for the resources that they use. Whatever they use is what they pay for
    * better cost prediction
      * you can get metrics from the cloud providers based on your previous usage to predict your future usage

* Cloud benefits
  * high avalibility
  * reliability
  * security
    * cloud is super secure
  * managebility
  * scalability
  * predictability
  * governance
    * gives management the ability to see what operations are spending and on what in the cloud
  * elasticity

* Cloud service types:
  * Iaas
  * Paas
  * Saas

* Iaas
  * build pay-as0you-go IT infrastructure by renting servers, virtual machines, storage, networks and operating systems from a cloud provider
  * gives customer the most control
  * has the highest cost
  * they specify the infrastructure they need
  
* Paas
  * provides environment for building, testing and deploying applications; without focuing on managing underlying infrastructure
  * gives customer the medium control
  * has mid level costs

* Saas
  * users connect to and use cloud-based apps over the internet
  * i.e. Microsoft office 365, email and calenders
  * gives customer the lest control
  * has the lowest cost
